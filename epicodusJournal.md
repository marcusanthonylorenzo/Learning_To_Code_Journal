## Journal Log Week 2, March 21 2022.

### Prompt (My answers are not indented.)
> You've already spent at least 40 hours programming in class. (Not counting any additional hours outside of class). In the first section you've undoubtedly already experienced both breakthroughs and victories, and frustrating bugs. This is all simply part of programming! And when facing those bugs and issues, all programmers have to ask for help sometimes. Even the most senior developers face bugs they can't seem to solve alone, and/or need a second pair of eyes on their code.

>- Think about asking for help in the classroom. Are there times when it's easier or harder for you to ask for assistance from a peer? What about a teacher?

It's only hard when the partner doesn't communicate freely. Some people prefer to not talk much and that's okay. However, it makes it difficult to share ideas, and some people are very "matter-of-fact" - making it slightly offensive to sensitive personalities.

>- What factors make it harder to ask for help? Why do these stand in your way?

As stated above: it depends on the personality, ability, and confidence of said person. I would never want to force someone to do something they don't want to do/don't feel comfortable doing. However, in our program, and in Agile processes in general, it is paramount that pairs work together towards a common goal.

>- What can you do to minimize or eliminate these factors? In what ways could you practice sharing your problem solving process throughout the week?

Find the way people prefer to work. State and be clear with your goals - they can be ever-changing. Patience is key. It doesn't matter who or how "good" your partner is - get the job done and try to have fun.
