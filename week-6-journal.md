### Prompts followed by answers
#### 1. Browse Postings, what are you drawn to/not drawn to?
The title I find myself drawn to is certaintly "Front-End Developer", as I am most comfortable with Javascript. I cannot say I can code in anything else. I also thoroughly enjoy design and architecture, I have mentioned to many people that my heart tells me I belong in UX/UI or Front-End design. I would also enjoy making mobile apps surely, and ultimately I do not want to limit my opportunities in Tech. I would, realistically, take any position given to me. I may very well be good at Data Science or a language like Java...who knows?

I have heard that "QA" is a field where aspiring developers get "pidgeon-holed" and it is difficult to move across the field after a certain amount of time in Testing. I wouldn't be adverse to a QA position, but I would very much prefer a position with an element of "design".

Details that stand out to me in Front-End job-positings would have to be:
* Keyword, again, being "design".
* UI
* "Creating reusable, testable code." -it must show a level of organization and efficiency, the same way I've worked as a Chef.
* Self-starter.


#### 2. Write Your Own Job Description
My Ideal Job Position:
* A company focused on growth, and investing in team. I would work below-average pay if the environment was positive.
* Working on-site or remote.
* Small teams tend to be more personable, less expendable.
* Health benefits and free-parking would be ideal.
* Travel is totally fine. I am a bachelor with no long-standing debt.
