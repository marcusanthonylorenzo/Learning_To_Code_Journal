## This week's goals:
- Improve TDD writing
- Learn to refactor
- Improve README's
- Understand OOP in JS.



### Prompts followed by answers
#### When, like all developers, you encounter a problem you can't immediately solve, what's your internal reaction? Is it along the lines of "Oh, I'm not smart enough for this.", more like "Okay, I just need to learn more.", or something else?

The honest truth is always have a dialogue going on in my head, even if I'm just sipping coffee at 7am on a Tuesday. Amongst encounter of a difficult problem, the most common dialogue that triggers begins with: "why??" Why is "this" happening? What is causing it and what will result from it? What should I do and is it in my scope of responsibility? And when I take responsibility, what cost should I be ready to pay? (Cost in the sense of mental fortitude and effort)

This line of questioning gives me a foundation of sorts - a framework if you will - to bring order to a sudden, chaotic, mental scenario. When I choose to attack the issue(s) at hand, I prefer to develop general concepts and principles that are dependant on the nature of the problem (if it's academic: what are the references, the sources, and subject matter? If it is a personal issue: what actions have sequenced and between who? What are the emotional states of these people and how do they respond under duress? What language do I use to communicate that will be perceived correctly, and *most importantly* what information do I REALLY want to relay?

#### Be honest, what do you value and praise yourself for more? Innately/already knowing how to solve a problem? Or being able to stick with it, research, troubleshoot, and learn more to debug?

The latter. Through the struggle can you really define character. Not everything needs to be won, but I've still come to "fight".

#### Based on your answers to questions above, do you think you have a growth mindset? Why or why not?

Absolutely. To be honest, there have only been a handful of things I've ever done 100%. This coding bootcamp is one of them. I've quit my job, I study 6-7 days a week (not aimlessly either: **I've developed my own curriculum for the past five months** structured around Udemy courses in HTML/CSS, Javascript, React, and Data Structures/Algorithms (with Andrei Neagoie, Jonas Schmedtmann, Brad Traversy, and Colt Steele...all respectively). I will become a clean and efficient programmer, period.

#### If you don't currently have a growth mindset, identify what you could do differently to begin fostering one. Or, if you already think you do, what could you to do maximize it?

Take breaks. Keep it simple. Stop overthinking your code. Be succinct but methodical. I will read this one day and laugh about it all. As they always say: "trust the process".
